Commercial Bike Store

Implemented a commercial bike store management system in C using binary trees and linked lists. This project aims to automate all the existing manual records into a computerized system.


The project is about a bike store in a city. It’s a huge store which has many branches throughout the city. They sell all kinds of bikes starting from the most basic daily use ones to electronic ones and also the high-end sports bikes. The owner still follows primitive and old methods to keep track of all the sales in the stores.

1.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project is about a bike store in a city. They sell all kinds of bikes there starting from the most basic daily use ones to electronic ones and also the high-end sports bikes. The owner still follows primitive and old methods to keep track of all the sales in the stores. He stores all the sales details on paper by manually writing them. This is not a convenient method as it wastes a lot of writing all details on paper also it is a very slow process and is not safe also. Since he is growing old it is getting difficult to carry out such a tedious task and it can lead to many errors. The owner’s son suggests his dad to computerize this data and he agrees to do so. The storing of data in a system using a binary tree implemented using linked lists is a very efficient method. It reduces time and rules out any chance of getting an error. He can easily view the data and it's faster. Even the customers are benefited from this as they can easily check the availability of bikes, etc. There will be two users in this project. One is the customer who can view/search for a bike based on year of release (daily use, electrical, sport bikes), can see the oldest and latest bikes etc. Another user is the owner/admin who can do many tasks like add bikes, remove bikes etc.

1.2 OBJECTIVES
The software has two modes: the owners view and the customers view When the user is the owner/admin:
• User can display and arrange the bikes based on the year of release. 
• User can see add the type of bike (electrical, daily use, racing bikes)
• User which is the oldest model bike in the shop.
• User sees which is the latest model bike in the shop.
• User has control to add bikes.
• User has control to delete/remove bikes. 
• Can see if a bike is available.

In the customer mode:
• Customer can see which is the oldest model bike in the shop. 
• Customer can check if the bike is available in-store or not.
• Customer can see which is the latest model bike in the shop. 
• Customers can also view the bikes based on the year of release.
