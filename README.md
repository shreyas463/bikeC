# Commercial Bike Store



1.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project is about a bike store in a city. The storage of data in a system using a binary tree implemented using linked lists is a very efficient method. It reduces time and rules out any chance of making an error. He can easily view the data, and it's faster. Even the customers benefit from this, as they can easily check the availability of bikes, etc. There will be two users for this project. One is the customer, who can view or search for a bike based on year of release (daily use, electrical, sport bikes), see the oldest and latest bikes, etc. Another user is the owner or administrator, who can do many tasks like adding bikes, removing bikes, etc.
